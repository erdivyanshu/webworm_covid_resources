        COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.
        You may have side effects after vaccination, but these side effects are normal.
        It typically takes two weeks after you are fully vaccinated for the body to build protection (immunity) against
        the virus that causes COVID-19.
        <br>
        If you have a chance to get vaccinated either by the one manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited - Covaxin® or
        the one by Oxford - AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India. Both the institutions are
        globally acclaimed and have been supplying various safe and effective vaccines across the world. Don’t be
        waylaid by rumors and WhatsApp knowledge.<br> The one produced by Bharat Bio-Tech is from an attenuated Covid-19
        strain while the one from Oxford Astra Zeneca is from the DNA Technique. Both vaccines have almost 90%
        efficiency rate. The vaccination centers are also well equipped to respond immediately if you develop a severe
        allergic reaction post-vaccination.

  <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

  <div class="ayushi1">

    <div class="ayu2">
      <h3 style="color:rgb(90, 0, 0)">How do COVID-19 vaccines work?</h3><br>
      <p>
        Vaccines work by mimicking an infectious agent – viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms that can cause a
        disease. This ‘teaches’ our immune system to rapidly and effectively respond against it.

        Traditionally, vaccines have done this by introducing a weakened form of an infectious agent that allows our
        immune system to build a memory of it. This way, our immune system can quickly recognize and fight it before it
        makes us ill. That’s how some of the COVID-19 vaccines have been designed.

        Other COVID-19 vaccines have been developed using new approaches, which are called messenger RNA, or mRNA,
        vaccines. Instead of introducing antigens (a substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies),
        mRNA vaccines give our body the genetic code it needs to allow our immune system to produce the antigen itself.
        mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades. They contain no live virus and do not interfere
        with human DNA.

  <div class="ayushi2">
    <h3 style="color:rgb(90, 0, 0)">Will the COVID-19 vaccines work against the new variants?</h3><br>
    <p>WHO says that the vaccines approved are expected to provide some protection against the new variants.

      Experts around the world are continuously studying how the new variants affect the behaviour of the virus,
      including any potential impact on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.

      Should any of the vaccines be shown to be less effective against one or more of these variants, it will be
      possible to change the composition of the vaccines to protect against them. In the future, changes to vaccinations
      such as the use of booster shots and other updates may be necessary.
      <br>
      But in the meantime, the important thing to do is to get vaccinated and continue measures to reduce the spread of
      the virus which helps to reduce the chances for the virus to mutate including physical distancing, mask wearing,
      good ventilation, regular handwashing and seeking care early if you have symptoms.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ayushi3">
    <h3 style="color:rgb(90, 0, 0)">Should my child get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h3><br>
    <p>
      Children’s immune systems are different from those of adults and can vary significantly depending on their age. At
      present, WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines are not recommended for anyone under the age of 16-18 years (depending on
      the individual vaccine), even if they belong to a high-risk group.<br> Children were not included in the initial
      trials for COVID-19 vaccines, so there is currently limited or no data on the safety or efficacy of vaccines for
      children below the age of 16. More research is needed and we will update the recommendations as trials are
      conducted and more information becomes available.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ayushi4">
    <h3 style="color:rgb(90, 0, 0)">I’ve seen inaccurate information online about COVID-19 vaccines. What should I do?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      Sadly, there is a lot of inaccurate information online about the COVID-19 virus and vaccines. Misinformation in a
      health crisis can spread paranoia, fear and stigmatization. It can also result in people being left unprotected or
      more vulnerable to the virus. Get verified facts and advice from trusted sources like your local health authority,
      the UN, UNICEF, WHO.<br>

      If you see content online that you believe to be false or misleading, you can help stop it spreading by reporting
      it to the social media platform.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ayushi5">
    <h3 style="color:rgb(90, 0, 0)">
      How can I protect my family until we all receive a COVID-19 vaccine?
    </h3><br>
    <p>
      For the time being, even once vaccinated we need to continue taking precautions to protect ourselves and others.
      This includes wearing masks, physical distancing and regular handwashing.
